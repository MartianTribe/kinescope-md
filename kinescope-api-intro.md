# Kinescope API

Kinescope provides an API to enable you to programmatically stream and manage your video content.

## Prerequirements

- A Kinescope account is required to utilize the APIs. You can create an account here: [https://app.kinescope.io](https://app.kinescope.io)
- An API key is also required for authentication purposes. Follow these steps to create an API key.
    1. `Log into your account`.
    2. Once in your dashboard, at the bottom of the left side navigation, `click on the account icon`.
    3. In the `pop over window` that displays, click on the `Settings` link.
    4. A `Settings options` list will display at the top left of the screen, click on the `API Token` link.
    5. The `API Token Window` will display. At the top right of the screen, click the `+ New Token` button to create an `API token`.

A new token will appear in your `API token list`. Give the token a unique name. You can now copy and use this token to authenticate into your project.
